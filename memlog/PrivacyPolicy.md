# Speech Dictation - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-12-31

Speech Dictation is designed for on-device transcription and optional camera-based accessibility features. We do not collect or transmit your audio, transcripts, or camera data unless you explicitly share or export them.

## Data We Create and Store
- Audio recordings and transcripts are stored locally on your device.
- Exported files are created only when you initiate an export or share action.
- Optional model downloads (for camera features) may fetch model files from external servers; user content is never uploaded as part of these downloads.

## Permissions We Request
- Microphone: required for transcription and recording.
- Camera: required for the experimental camera experience.
- Face ID: optional protection for secure recordings.
- Background audio: required for continued recording when the app is not active.

## Sharing and Exports
- Sharing uses the iOS share sheet and is always user-initiated.
- We do not automatically send data to third parties.

## Your Controls
- You can delete recordings and transcripts from the app.
- You can revoke permissions at any time in iOS Settings.
