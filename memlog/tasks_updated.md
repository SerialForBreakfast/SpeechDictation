**User Story:**
_As a user, I want my audio recordings stored with precise timing data, so I can replay audio with synced transcripts and export it in formats like SRT for professional use._

---

**Subtasks Breakdown:**

#### ‚úÖ UI Layer
- [ ] Playback controls: Play, Pause, Stop
- [ ] Speed adjustment (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)
- [ ] Seek-to-text functionality (tap to jump)
- [ ] Real-time waveform display with current position
- [ ] Display duration and timestamp overlay

#### ‚úÖ Logic / Services
- [ ] `AudioRecordingManager`
  - Capture audio with high-quality config (sample rate, bit depth)
  - Implement efficient storage and compression
- [ ] `TimingDataManager`
  - Persist millisecond-level timing metadata
  - Conform to `Sendable` and isolate state via `actor`
- [ ] `ExportManager`
  - Add support for `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.ttml` formats
  - Use `TimingDataManager` output as input for export
- [ ] `AudioPlaybackManager`
  - Load, buffer, and sync audio with transcript
  - Manage seek logic and handle playback speed

#### üîÅ Integration Points
- [ ] Extend `SpeechRecognizer`:
  - Capture timestamps from `SpeechRecognitionResult`
  - Hand off segment/timing data to `TimingDataManager`
- [ ] Synchronize playback UI with `AudioPlaybackManager`
- [ ] Ensure `ExportManager` pulls unified data from all services

#### üßµ Concurrency Requirements
- All mutable state (timing, audio) managed within `actors`
- Export tasks and audio file writing must use `async let` or `Task.detached`
- Avoid blocking operations; schedule disk I/O on background threads
- Closure and manager interfaces must be `@Sendable`
