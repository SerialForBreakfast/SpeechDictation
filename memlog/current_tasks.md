# Current Tasks

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Audio Recording and Transcription Timing System
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added comprehensive audio recording and transcription timing system
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Created TimingDataManager for managing timing data with millisecond precision
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added AudioRecordingManager for high-quality audio recording with configurable quality settings
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Created AudioPlaybackManager for audio playback with timing synchronization
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added ExportManager with multiple export formats (SRT, VTT, JSON, CSV)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Integrated all components into Xcode project with proper target membership
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fixed build errors and concurrency issues
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added simulator-specific audio format validation to prevent crashes
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fixed audio tap installation crash by adding proper format validation

### Audio Format Validation Fix
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Identified crash caused by invalid audio format (0 sample rate, 0 channels) in simulator
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added validation in `startTranscribingWithTiming()` method to check format before installing tap
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added validation in `setupTapForAudioPlayer()` method for consistency
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Added simulator-specific error handling to continue gracefully when audio engine fails
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fixed unused variable warning in SpeechRecognizer+Timing.swift
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Verified all tests pass and app builds successfully

None currently.

## üìã PENDING TASKS

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding more export formats (WebVTT, ASS/SSA)
- Add audio visualization features
- Implement real-time transcription timing display
- Add support for multiple audio input sources
- Consider adding audio effects and filters

### Testing and Validation
- Test on real iOS devices to verify audio recording functionality
- Add more comprehensive unit tests for timing data management
- Test export functionality with various audio formats
- Validate timing accuracy with known audio files

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

None currently.

## üìù NOTES

- The audio recording system is now robust and handles simulator limitations gracefully
- All audio-related crashes have been resolved through proper format validation
- The timing system provides millisecond precision for transcription segments
- Export functionality supports multiple industry-standard formats
- The system is ready for real device testing
