Purpose
- Track known failure modes and current mitigations. Update status after device validation.

================================================================================
Failure 001 - Event stream subscription order
================================================================================
Status
- Mitigated in code; needs device validation.

Notes
- Subscribe to engine.eventStream() before engine.start() so early events are not dropped.

================================================================================
Failure 002 - Timestamp resets on recognition restarts
================================================================================
Status
- Mitigated in LegacyTranscriptionEngine; needs long-session validation.

Notes
- Session-level offsets are applied to timing segments to keep timestamps monotonic.

================================================================================
Failure 003 - External audio buffer routing
================================================================================
Status
- Mitigated in SpeechRecognizer; verify secure recording live transcript.

Notes
- External buffers must be forwarded to the active transcription engine.

================================================================================
Failure 004 - Camera model load failure fallback
================================================================================
Status
- Known gap.

Notes
- CameraExperienceView falls back to CameraErrorView; retry logic is TODO.
