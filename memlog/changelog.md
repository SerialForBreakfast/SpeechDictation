## [2025-07-10] - Audio Quality Settings Conflict Resolution & iPhone Crash Fix

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Resolved duplicate `AudioQualitySettings` struct definitions causing compilation errors
  - Removed duplicate struct from `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Updated code to use existing `AudioQualitySettings` from `TimingData.swift`
  - Fixed type ambiguity issues with explicit type annotations
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed iPhone crash due to invalid audio hardware format
  - Added robust validation of native audio format before proceeding
  - Enhanced error messages to identify hardware configuration issues
  - Improved audio session setup with better fallback handling
  - Added critical error reporting for device-specific audio engine failures

### Technical Details
- **AudioQualitySettings Conflict**: The struct was defined in both `TimingData.swift` and `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Kept the more complete version in `TimingData.swift` (includes `compressionQuality`)
  - Updated `AudioRecordingManager.swift` to use the existing definition
  - Added explicit type annotations to resolve compiler ambiguity
- **iPhone Audio Crash**: The crash was caused by invalid audio hardware format (0 channels, 0 Hz)
  - Added validation before audio engine setup to catch invalid formats early
  - Enhanced error reporting to distinguish between simulator and device issues
  - Improved audio session configuration with better error handling

### Files Modified
- `SpeechDictation/Services/AudioRecordingManager.swift` - Removed duplicate struct, enhanced validation
- `SpeechDictation/Models/TimingData.swift` - Kept as the single source of truth for AudioQualitySettings

### Impact
- Resolves compilation errors and type ambiguity issues
- Prevents iPhone crashes due to invalid audio hardware configuration
- Improves error reporting for debugging audio issues on real devices
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing audio quality settings usage

## [2025-07-10] - Audio Quality Settings Compilation Fix & Format Mismatch Resolution

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Resolved `AudioQualitySettings` compilation issues by consolidating definition
  - Moved `AudioQualitySettings` struct definition to `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Removed duplicate definition from `TimingData.swift` to prevent redeclaration errors
  - Fixed "Cannot find type 'AudioQualitySettings' in scope" compilation errors
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed audio format mismatch crash on iPhone
  - Changed from forcing specific sample rate (22050 Hz) to using native hardware format (24000 Hz)
  - Eliminated "Input HW format and tap format not matching" crash
  - Improved audio session error handling with better fallback mechanisms

### Technical Details
- **Compilation Issue**: The compiler couldn't resolve `AudioQualitySettings` type due to module import issues
  - Temporarily moved struct definition to `AudioRecordingManager.swift` where it's used
  - Removed duplicate from `TimingData.swift` to prevent redeclaration conflicts
  - This resolves the "Cannot find type" compilation errors
- **Format Mismatch Crash**: The crash occurred because we were forcing a 22050 Hz format when hardware supports 24000 Hz
  - Changed to use `nativeFormat` instead of creating a desired format
  - This ensures the tap format matches the hardware format exactly
  - Added better error handling for audio session configuration failures

### Files Modified
- `SpeechDictation/Services/AudioRecordingManager.swift` - Added AudioQualitySettings definition, fixed format handling
- `SpeechDictation/Models/TimingData.swift` - Removed duplicate AudioQualitySettings definition

### Impact
- Resolves all compilation errors related to AudioQualitySettings
- Prevents iPhone crashes due to audio format mismatches
- Improves audio recording reliability on real devices
- Maintains all existing functionality while fixing critical issues
