## [2025-07-10] - Audio Quality Settings Conflict Resolution & iPhone Crash Fix

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Resolved duplicate `AudioQualitySettings` struct definitions causing compilation errors
  - Removed duplicate struct from `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Updated code to use existing `AudioQualitySettings` from `TimingData.swift`
  - Fixed type ambiguity issues with explicit type annotations
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed iPhone crash due to invalid audio hardware format
  - Added robust validation of native audio format before proceeding
  - Enhanced error messages to identify hardware configuration issues
  - Improved audio session setup with better fallback handling
  - Added critical error reporting for device-specific audio engine failures

### Technical Details
- **AudioQualitySettings Conflict**: The struct was defined in both `TimingData.swift` and `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Kept the more complete version in `TimingData.swift` (includes `compressionQuality`)
  - Updated `AudioRecordingManager.swift` to use the existing definition
  - Added explicit type annotations to resolve compiler ambiguity
- **iPhone Audio Crash**: The crash was caused by invalid audio hardware format (0 channels, 0 Hz)
  - Added validation before audio engine setup to catch invalid formats early
  - Enhanced error reporting to distinguish between simulator and device issues
  - Improved audio session configuration with better error handling

### Files Modified
- `SpeechDictation/Services/AudioRecordingManager.swift` - Removed duplicate struct, enhanced validation
- `SpeechDictation/Models/TimingData.swift` - Kept as the single source of truth for AudioQualitySettings

### Impact
- Resolves compilation errors and type ambiguity issues
- Prevents iPhone crashes due to invalid audio hardware configuration
- Improves error reporting for debugging audio issues on real devices
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing audio quality settings usage

## [2025-07-10] - Audio Quality Settings Compilation Fix & Format Mismatch Resolution

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Resolved `AudioQualitySettings` compilation issues by consolidating definition
  - Moved `AudioQualitySettings` struct definition to `AudioRecordingManager.swift`
  - Removed duplicate definition from `TimingData.swift` to prevent redeclaration errors
  - Fixed "Cannot find type 'AudioQualitySettings' in scope" compilation errors
- **Critical Bug**: Fixed audio format mismatch crash on iPhone
  - Changed from forcing specific sample rate (22050 Hz) to using native hardware format (24000 Hz)
  - Eliminated "Input HW format and tap format not matching" crash
  - Improved audio session error handling with better fallback mechanisms

### Technical Details
- **Compilation Issue**: The compiler couldn't resolve `AudioQualitySettings` type due to module import issues
  - Temporarily moved struct definition to `AudioRecordingManager.swift` where it's used
  - Removed duplicate from `TimingData.swift` to prevent redeclaration conflicts
  - This resolves the "Cannot find type" compilation errors
- **Format Mismatch Crash**: The crash occurred because we were forcing a 22050 Hz format when hardware supports 24000 Hz
  - Changed to use `nativeFormat` instead of creating a desired format
  - This ensures the tap format matches the hardware format exactly
  - Added better error handling for audio session configuration failures

### Files Modified
- `SpeechDictation/Services/AudioRecordingManager.swift` - Added AudioQualitySettings definition, fixed format handling
- `SpeechDictation/Models/TimingData.swift` - Removed duplicate AudioQualitySettings definition

### Impact

**Summary**: Enhanced scene detection with temporal analysis, fixed camera settings persistence, and added reset functionality for better user experience.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Enhanced Scene Detection with Temporal Analysis**:
   - `Places365SceneDescriber.swift`: Completely rewritten with advanced scene analysis
   - **Multi-Result Analysis**: Processes top 5 classification results for better accuracy
   - **Temporal Stability**: Tracks scene history to reduce flickering and improve stability
   - **Contextual Enhancement**: Combines multiple results for better scene descriptions
   - **Scene Categorization**: Automatically categorizes scenes (Indoor, Outdoor, Commercial, Transportation)
   - **Confidence Tracking**: Maintains confidence levels over time for stable results

2. **Fixed Camera Settings Behavior**:
   - `CameraSceneDescriptionViewModel.swift`: Added settings checks in processing pipeline
   - **Conditional Processing**: Only processes object detection when `enableObjectDetection` is true
   - **Conditional Scene Analysis**: Only processes scene description when `enableSceneDescription` is true
   - **Automatic Clearing**: Clears overlays when features are disabled
   - **Real-time Updates**: Settings changes take effect immediately

3. **Fixed UI Overlay Visibility**:
   - `CameraSceneDescriptionView.swift`: Added conditional overlay display
   - **Blue Overlay**: Only shows when scene description is enabled
   - **Green Overlay**: Only shows when object detection is enabled
   - **Settings Integration**: Observes CameraSettingsManager for real-time updates

4. **Added Reset Functionality**:
   - `CameraSettingsManager.swift`: Added `resetToDefaults()` method with default values enum
   - `CameraExperienceView.swift`: Added reset button in CameraSettingsView
   - **Haptic Feedback**: Provides tactile feedback when resetting settings
   - **Immediate Effect**: All settings reset to defaults with instant UI updates

5. **Enhanced Settings Persistence**:
   - All settings already persist to UserDefaults automatically
   - Settings are restored on app launch
   - Reset functionality verified to work correctly

**Technical Improvements**:
- **Temporal Analysis**: 10-frame history buffer for scene stability
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Stability threshold (60%) and transition threshold (40%)
- **Scene Categories**: Predefined categories for better context
- **Memory Management**: Efficient circular buffer for scene history
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when detection fails

**Scene Detection Options Available**:
1. **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combine Vision + CoreML for better accuracy
2. **Temporal Scene Analysis**: Track changes over time (✅ Implemented)
3. **Custom CoreML Model**: Deploy specialized scene models
4. **Semantic Segmentation**: Pixel-level scene understanding

**Build Status**: ✅ All changes successfully compiled and tested

**Files Modified**:
- `SpeechDictation/todofiles/Places365SceneDescriber.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/todofiles/CameraSceneDescriptionViewModel.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/todofiles/CameraSceneDescriptionView.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/Services/CameraSettingsManager.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/UI/CameraExperienceView.swift`

## [Previous Session] - Multiple Object Detection Implementation

### Multiple Object Detection for High Confidence Items

**Summary**: Enhanced object detection to support multiple high-confidence objects with improved UI display and configurable sensitivity.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Connected Detection Sensitivity Setting**:
   - `YOLOv3Model.swift`: Updated to use `CameraSettingsManager.shared.detectionSensitivity` instead of hardcoded 0.3 threshold
   - Now uses configurable confidence threshold from 0.1 to 0.9 (default 0.5)
   - Fixed Float/Double type compatibility issue

2. **Removed Artificial Object Limits**:
   - `ObjectDetectionOverlayView.swift`: Increased from 3 to 6 objects maximum
   - `CameraSceneDescriptionView.swift`: Increased from 3 to 6 objects maximum
   - Supports user's request for multiple high-confidence object detection

3. **Improved Object Display**:
   - **Adaptive Font Sizing**: Uses `.caption` for 4+ objects, `.subheadline` for 1-3 objects
   - **Adaptive Line Limits**: 6 lines for 4+ objects, 3 lines for 1-3 objects
   - **Adaptive Padding**: 16pt for 4+ objects, 12pt for 1-3 objects
   - **Better Formatting**: Line breaks for 4+ objects, comma separation for 1-3 objects

4. **Enhanced UI Layout**:
   - Dynamic overlay sizing based on number of detected objects
   - Improved readability for multiple objects with line-break formatting
   - Maintained green color scheme for object detection consistency

**Technical Details**:
- **Confidence Threshold**: Now configurable via CameraSettingsManager (0.1-0.9 range)
- **Object Display**: Up to 6 high-confidence objects shown (previously limited to 3)
- **UI Adaptation**: Font size, padding, and line limits adjust based on object count
- **Formatting**: Multi-line display for 4+ objects, comma-separated for fewer objects

**Build Status**: ✅ All changes successfully compiled and tested

**Files Modified**:
- `SpeechDictation/Models/YOLOv3Model.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/todofiles/ObjectDetectionOverlayView.swift`
- `SpeechDictation/todofiles/CameraSceneDescriptionView.swift`

### Dark/Light Mode & UI Improvements

**Summary**: Comprehensive dark/light mode improvements across all UI views with semantic color support and camera interface enhancements.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Entry View Color Fixes**:
   - `EntryView.swift`: Fixed hardcoded colors with semantic alternatives
   - Updated card backgrounds to use `Color(UIColor.systemBackground)` and `secondarySystemBackground`
   - Enhanced gradient colors with proper dark/light mode opacity (0.15/0.08)
   - Improved shadow colors with dark/light mode adaptation

2. **Camera Interface Enhancements**:
   - `CameraSceneDescriptionView.swift`: Made blue (scene) and green (object) overlays always visible
   - `SceneDetectionOverlayView.swift`: Added "Analyzing scene..." fallback for undetected state
   - `ObjectDetectionOverlayView.swift`: Added "No objects detected" fallback with proper green styling
   - `BoundingBoxOverlayView.swift`: Enhanced UIKit overlay with consistent green color scheme

3. **Core UI Components**:
   - `ContentView.swift`: Updated all button backgrounds with semantic colors and adaptive opacity
   - `SettingsView.swift`: Replaced hardcoded gray with semantic colors and adaptive shadows
   - `ThemeSettingView.swift`: Fixed white-on-gray button contrast issues
   - `TextSizeSettingView.swift`: Updated slider and background colors
   - `MicSensitivityView.swift`: Added proper text color adaptation
   - `NativeStyleShareView.swift`: Fixed compilation issues and updated to semantic colors

4. **UIKit Import Justification**:
   - Comprehensive audit confirmed all UIKit imports are properly justified
   - **SettingsView**: UIColor for semantic colors
   - **LiveCameraView**: UIDevice orientation, AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer for camera
   - **ExportManager**: UIApplication, UIActivityViewController for sharing
   - **AlertManager**: UIViewController, UIAlertController for alerts
