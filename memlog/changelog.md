### Features Working
- Live speech-to-text transcription from microphone
- Real-time audio buffer processing and waveform display
- Theme switching (Light, Dark, High Contrast)
- Adjustable transcription text size
- Audio volume control
- Permission handling for microphone and speech recognition
- Audio session configuration for recording

### Known Issues
